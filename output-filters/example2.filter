# example.filter and example2.filter won't get copied to the Path of Exile
# directory. They are meant to explain how to use all the different commands.
# Please see example.filter for a full explaination of commands.
# #! poe2 means the filter is for Path of Exile 2.
# Path of Exile (1) filters seems to be mostly compatible with Path of Exile 2
# besides the absence of socket links in items.
